# data is currently structured as subsamples, replicates, across treatments. We know from 
# http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/11/074633 that the organisms were most abundant in
# Alfalfa and no-till treatments, so we should use data from these treatments if we're 
# interested in picking up trends over time. We also don't really care about within
# year dynamics for this experiment- we essentially want a summary measure of what was going on
#within a rep, within a year. So let's reshape the data, drop out irrelevant treatments.
